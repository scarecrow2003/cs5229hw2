################################################
The policy is configured to when "eth_type" is "0x0800"(TYPE_IPv4) and "ip_proto" is "0x11"(UDP) and the port is within
the range of 1000 ~ 1100, the package will be dropped (actions do nothing). Since we cannot do range match for port, if
we create one rule for every port, there will be 100 rules. So I come out with the bit mask way. It contains 6 rules
(0x03e8/0xfff8 for port 1000 ~ 1007, 0x03f0/0xfff0 for port 1008 ~ 1023, 0x0400/0xffc0 for port 1024 ~ 1087,
0x0440/0xfff8 for port 1088 ~ 1095, 0x0448/0xfffc for port 1096 ~ 1099 and port 1100).
Below shows some iperf3 logs from S2 to S3. The logs from S3 to S2 is similar.

For port 999, which is outside the blocking range, the traffic can pass:

Policy 3
################################################
The policy is set inside a while loop. Inside the while loop, the code will query the switch, if the byte count of the
policy reaches the limit, it will send a policy to the switch to change the policy and increase the limit.
The difference of the two policy is inside the action. They will use different queue @1 and @2 to apply different rate limit.
Between every query, we will set appropriate sleep time according the remaining bit count and rate limit, so that we
don't send too many query to the switch and make the system unresponsible.
